The tutorial I went through for springBoot+React, could be a starting place for the code

### Alright team here's how this works
- first you clone it. yuh.
- Then you run ./mvnw spring-boot:run
- You might run into issues with it not finding your JAVA_HOME or M2_HOME. These need to point to the place where your jdk are and the place on your machine [this](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is located.
- If it works, you'll see the Spring ascii art 
- please lmk if you have questions
